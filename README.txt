Quasar: fonts for Quikscript
=================================

Version 1.000

These fonts are distributed in two formats: TTF for installation on computers; and WOFF for embedding in Web pages. The source code for generating the fonts is available on Github [1]. The Quikscript characters are mapped to the Unicode Private Use Area, so youâ€™ll need to install a special keyboard layout to type with them. Finally, the fonts are all available under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 [2]. This means they may be freely used, distributed, extended and adapted.

This font was inspired by geometric typefaces of the Bauhaus school. A key design principle of mine was to avoid diagonal lines, leading to the use of many curves. What else is known for its roundness? The celestial radio sources known as quasars derive their energy from black holes, which are some of the roundest things in the universe behind neutron stars. (Okay, it was a bit of a stretch to make this one fit my naming scheme of words beginning with Q, but the word Quasar does serve as an excellent demonstration of its design characteristics!).

Quasar comes in two styles, both as variable fonts with weight ranging from Thin to Black:

- Open: with small openings in the counters of letters like a, b, et cetera, much like the 20th-century typefaces which inspired this one.
- Closed: with more conventional, closed counters in those letters, lending this style a more contemporary appearance.

Quasar replaces my previous fonts, both unfinished and previously unreleased: QS Round (2018) and QS Rotund (2019). [3].
